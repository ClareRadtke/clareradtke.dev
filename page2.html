    My hobbies include reading - I go through a few books a month, any typoe of fiction, fantasy or a biography if I am interested in the subject - and doll customisation.. not a lot of people are familiar with this so here is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/souls_in_dolls/">my Instagram for reference</a></p>
